## Agenda

- UIKit
- Scenes, Views and View Controllers
- View's lifecycle
- Wireframes
- Tutorial

<!-- > -->

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:

- Identify common elements in iOS apps
- Understand the relationship between scenes, views and view controllers
- Describe MVC (Model, View, Controller) pattern
- Use Autolayout to arrange elements in a view

## Keeping us updated


[iOS 14](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-14/)

[Xcode 12](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

<aside class="notes">
iOS is the mobile operating system created by Apple Inc. It runs on iPhone, iPad, iPod, Macs, Apple Watch. There‚Äôs a new release every year.

Xcode is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed by Apple for developing software for macOS, iOS, tvOS & watchOS.

## What is UIKit?

- The core framework that helps us build iOS apps.
- Has default core components (buttons, sliders, image views). Same look and feel.
- Provides a base app with functionality to start working with.
- Main components: **Scenes**, **View Controllers** and **Views**.

<!-- > -->

‚ÄúThis framework lets apps achieve a **consistent appearance** across the system, while at the same time offering a high level of **customization**. UIKit elements are **flexible** and **familiar**. They‚Äôre adaptable, enabling you to design a single app that looks great on any iOS device, and they **automatically update when the system introduces appearance changes.**‚Äù

<!-- > -->

## How an app is made

Every app is made up of scenes and transitions between scenes.

![scenes](assets/scenes.png)

<!-- > -->

The first thing we need to do when creating a new app is to think:

- What can the app do?
- Where are things happening, in what scenes?
- How many scenes do we need?
- What are the possible transitions between scenes?

<!-- > -->

**Scenes**

Scenes consist of *View Controllers* and *Views*.

<!-- > -->

**View Controllers (VC)**

Are the containers for the views.

In most cases: one scene will have one view controller.

- Each view controller has one root view
- We can add more views as *subviews* to the root view of the view controller.
- View controllers are not something we can see, they need a view at least.
- Manage views
- Get informed about different system events (rotating, view appeared/disappeared)

<!-- > -->

**Views**

Anything that displays in the screen is a view.

They all share common properties (size, position, receive user input)

UIKit provides subclasses that represent components:
  - buttons
  - textfields
  - date pickers ...

<!-- > -->

### View lifecycle

Views have different stages: when they are created, shown, disappear and destroyed.

For every one of these stages, the View Controller associated with the view will receive an event that we can handle.

<!-- > -->

`ViewDidLoad`

Called as soon as the view is loaded for the first time.

We can initialize properties here.

<!-- > -->

`ViewWillAppear`/ `ViewDidAppear`

As soon as the view appears on screen.

The importance to differentiate them is if we are using animations to present views.

**Good place to load data.**

<!-- > -->

`ViewWillDisappear`/ `ViewDidDisappear`

Good place to save data, clean up resources,

## IBOutlets and IBActions

Once you've built your interaface with storyboard you will have interactive elements that need to be connected to code. This is done via IBoutlets and IBActions. 

Imagine you have have a simple app with a button and a text label. Clicking the button will display a text message in the text label. To do this you need an IBoutlet for the text label and an IBAction for the button. 

- IBOutlets are references to objects in your UI. They allow you to set properties on those objects. 
- IBActions are event listeners attached to a UI element. They invoke callback functions. 

Hold the control key and drag from an element in storyboard to your view controller swift file to create IBActions and IBOutlets.

## Building a wireframe

Let's say we want to turn the "Hotel management" program into a real app.

1. Think about the scenes the app needs.

2. Draw the elements each scene needs.
    - every element must be a native component of UIKit. Refer to the [Interface Essentials](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/interface-essentials/) You should be able to name every element in your scenes.

3. Draw the transitions between scenes. How do I get to each scene?

<!-- > -->

Share in pairs your designs.

- Any similar components?
- Major differences?
- Give each other feedback on what might be a better practice.

## Demo Building a screen with storyboards

Instructor takes a screen design and replicates it in the storyboard.

## MVC

![mvc](assets/mvc.png)

<!-- > -->

## Autolayout

Auto Layout **dynamically calculates** the size and position of all the views in the view hierarchy, **based on constraints** placed on those views.

This constraint-based approach to design allows you to build user interfaces that dynamically respond to both internal and external changes.

<!-- > -->

### External changes
Occur when the size or shape of your superview changes. And we must update the layout of the view hierarchy to best use the available space.

- The user enters or leaves Split View on an iPad
- The device rotates
- We want to support different orientations
- We want to support different screen sizes

<!-- > -->

### Internal changes

Occur when the size of the views or controls in the user interface change.

- The content displayed by the app changes
- The app supports internationalization
- The app supports Dynamic Type
